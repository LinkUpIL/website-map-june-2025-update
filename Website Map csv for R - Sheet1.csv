Top Box Market is an online grocery market that creates access to healthy, affordable food. We offer fresh fruits and vegetables, meats, seafood, and poultry, dairy, grains, meal kits, and more. To make grocery shopping easier for our community, we deliver for no added fee across Cook County every week. SNAP Shoppers double their dollar with the Link Match program, available in partnership with Experimental Station at Top Box Market. 

How It Works for Customers: Link Match at Top Box Market
-First, purchase any Top Box Market products with a Link Card. Shop online at topboxfoods.com or with support from our Customer Service team at 312-527-7890. When you place your first order, you’ll create an account on our website where you can view your Link Match and order history. 
-EBT/SNAP spending is matched dollar-for-dollar every order, earning you Link Match dollars to save money on your next Top Box Market order. Log into your Top Box Market account on our website and click the Link Match button in the corner to view your available Link Match dollars.
-Link Match dollars can be redeemed for products with fresh fruits and vegetables. To view the available options, go to topboxfoods.com/collections/linkmatch 
-When you’re ready to shop, add the products you’d like to order to your cart. At checkout, click Link Match to redeem the amount you’d like to save on the order. When you redeem, your Link Match dollars become a code valid for any products with fresh fruits or vegetables. Click “Discounts” to apply your new code to your order. Link Match can be redeemed in different amounts from $12.50 to $60, so you can use the right amount for the eligible products in your order.
-Your order will be delivered to your home on your chosen delivery day, so you can enjoy nutritious, fresh fruits and vegetables!
